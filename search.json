    "section": "",
    "text": "This study presents a novel DNA part characterization technique that increases throughput by combinatorial DNA part assembly, solid plate-based quantitative fluorescence assay for phenotyping, and barcode tagging-based long-read sequencing for genotyping. We confirmed that the fluorescence intensities of colonies on plates were comparable to fluorescence at the single-cell level from a high-end, flow-cytometry device and developed a high-throughput image analysis pipeline. The barcode tagging-based long-read sequencing technique enabled rapid identification of all DNA parts and their combinations with a single sequencing experiment. Using our techniques, forty-four DNA parts (21 promoters and 23 RBSs) were successfully characterized in 72 h without any automated equipment. We anticipate that this high-throughput and easy-to-use part characterization technique will contribute to increasing part diversity and be useful for building genetic circuits and metabolic pathways in synthetic biology.\n32(8), 1026-1033.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ceramides are a major lipid class known to play an essential role in maintaining skin function. Thus, efforts have been made to produce ceramides and ceramide precursors in large quantities for industrial applications. The yeast Wickerhamomyces ciferrii, a natural producer of the ceramide precursor tetraacetyl phytosphingosine (TAPS), has been isolated and engineered through various mutagenesis approaches aiming to enhance TAPS production. Herein, a high-throughput screening platform for isolating W. ciferrii mutants with improved TAPS production is described. A fluorescence-mediated reporter system that allows initial quantification of TAPS content in yeast cells based on BODIPY staining was developed. The optimal concentration of BODIPY for monitoring intracellular TAPS levels in W. ciferrii was 400 µg/L, as shown by a linear correlation between the actual TAPS levels and mean fluorescence intensities. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used for isolating high TAPS-producing strains from an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant library. After several rounds of sorting, mutants exhibiting a high-TAPS phenotype were isolated, and the M40 strain with the highest TAPS titer was chosen for large-scale cultivation. The influence of different carbon sources for optimizing TAPS production was also evaluated using the M40 strain. A maximum production yield of 5.114 g/L of ceramide precursors, including TAPS and triacetyl phytosphingosine, was achieved with the supplementation of molasses. This novel platform enables rapid screening of high TAPS-producing strains using the common dye BODIPY and can be easily extended for the development of mutants with high productivity of ceramide precursors in yeast and other microorganisms.\nKorean Journal of Chemical Engineering. 39, 4, 1004–1010.

Genetic engineering toolkits for methanotrophs are extremely limited. Here, we present a phenol-inducible promoter for the high-level expression of exogenous genes in methanotrophs. The phenol-inducible gene expression system showed high dose-dependency and homogeneity in methanotrophs. Using the phenol-inducible CRISPR-base editor (BE), we developed a highly efficient methanotroph genome editing system.

We adopted this simple and efficient genome editing tool to produce mevalonate in the engineered M. capsulatus Bath. The native phosphoketolase pathway was reinforced in M. capsulatus Bath to increase the carbon flux via acetyl-CoA towards mevalonate. This engineered M. capsulatus Bath produced the maximum concentration of 2,090 mg/L mevalonate from methane, which is the highest amount of synthetic biochemicals produced from methane in methanotrophs.

    "section": "",
    "text": "As the design of genetic circuitry for synthetic biology becomes more sophisticated, diverse regulatory bioparts are required. Despite their importance, well-characterized 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) bioparts are limited. Thus, transcript 3′-ends require further investigation to understand the underlying regulatory role and applications of the 3′-UTR. Here, we revisited the use of Term-Seq in the Escherichia coli strain K-12 MG1655 to enhance our understanding of 3′-UTR regulatory functions and to provide a diverse collection of tunable 3′-UTR bioparts with a wide termination strength range. Comprehensive analysis of 1,629 transcript 3′-end positions revealed multiple 3′-termini classes generated through transcription termination and RNA processing. The examination of individual Rho-independent terminators revealed a reduction in downstream gene expression over a wide range, which led to the design of novel synthetic metabolic valves that control metabolic fluxes in branched pathways. These synthetic metabolic valves determine the optimal balance of heterologous pathways for maximum target biochemical productivity. The regulatory strategy using 3′-UTR bioparts is advantageous over promoter- or 5′-UTR-based transcriptional control as it modulates gene expression at transcription levels without trans-acting element requirements (e.g. transcription factors). Our results provide a foundational platform for 3′-UTR engineering in synthetic biology applications.\nDOI:10.1093/nar/gkac206. IF19.160(2021y). Citation . ISSN no.0305-1048.\nOriginal article"

Here, a transcriptional factor-based screening strategy was used for the rapid screening of d-stereospecific amino acid amidase via an enzyme-specific amidophenol substrate. We used a d-threonine amidophenyl derivative to produce 2-aminophenol that serves as a putative enzyme indicator in the presence of d-threonine amidases. Comparative analyses of known bacterial species indicated that several Bacillus strains produce amidase and form putative indicators in culture media. The estimated amidase was cloned and subjected to rapid directed evolution through biosensor cells. Consequently, we characterized the F119A mutation that significantly improved the catalytic activity toward d-alanine, d-threonine, and d-glutamate. Its beneficial effects were confirmed by higher conversions and recurrent applications of the mutant enzyme, compared to the wild-type. This study showed that rapid directed evolution with biosensors coupled to designed substrates is useful to develop biocatalytic processes.\nDOI:10.1093/nar/gkac206. IF19.160(2022y). Citation .

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hanging drop plates and low-attachment well plates are suitable for a high throughput screening model of a spheroid, because each drop (or well) contains a single spheroid and the spheroid environment are separated from each other. However, uniform spheroid culture on these devices is difficult as the liquid around the spheroid is replaced by direct pipetting, which can cause spheroid damage or loss, and well-to-well variation. If spheroids need to be cultured for a long time or analyzed through chemical treatment of immunostaining, it becomes a more considerable problem as the number of pipetting action increases. To address these problems, we have developed a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-based drop array chip (DAC) and a pillar array chip (PAC) that can apply a droplet contact-based spheroid transfer (DCST) technique to multiple reagent change or washing steps of spheroid assays. Unlike previous DCST devices, 3D-printed mold-based DCST devices showed stable spheroid manipulation during repetitive drop contact and facile transfer of spheroid arrays to the next reagent-loaded DAC while minimizing cross-contamination of the reagents. Compared to the conventional manual or machine pipetting method, the DCST method showed lower user-to-user variation and a higher spheroid retention rate in the manipulation of the spheroid array. Live/dead staining, hypoxia staining, and immunofluorescence staining of the spheroid array were performed on a breast cancer cell line, BT-474.

(−)-α-Bisabolol is chemically synthesized and produced by steam distillation of essential oils extracted from Brazilian Candeia (Eremanthus erythropappus). To sustainably produce pure (−)-α-bisabolol, we previously engineered Escherichia coli to produce 9.1 g/L (−)-α-bisabolol via heterologous mevalonate pathways and (−)-α-bisabolol synthase (BOS) from German chamomile, Matricaria recutita (MrBOS). BOS has only been reported in MrBOS and Brazilian Candeia (EeBOS). The limited availability of BOS has made it difficult to achieve high titer and yield and large-scale (−)-α-bisabolol production. We identified a novel BOS in globe artichoke (CcBOS) and examined its functionality in vitro and in vivo. CcBOS showed higher catalytic efficiency and (−)-α-bisabolol production rates than those from MrBOS or EeBOS. In fed-batch fermentation, CcBOS generated the highest reported (−)-α-bisabolol titer to date (23.4 g/L).

    "section": "",
    "text": "Genetic circuits have been developed for quantitative measurement of enzyme activity, metabolic engineering of strain development, and dynamic regulation of microbial cells. A genetic circuit consists of several bio-elements, including enzymes and regulatory cassettes, that can generate the desired output signal, which is then used as a precise criterion for enzyme screening and engineering. Antagonists and inhibitors are small molecules with inhibitory effects on regulators and enzymes, respectively. In this study, an antagonist and an inhibitor were applied to a genetic circuit for a dynamic detection range. We developed a genetic circuit relying on regulators and enzymes, allowing for straightforward control of its output signal without additional genetic modification. We used para-nitrophenol and alanine as an antagonist of DmpR and inhibitor of tyrosine phenol-lyase, respectively. We show that the antagonist resets the detection range of the genetic circuit similarly to a resistor in an electrical logic circuit. These biological resistors in genetic circuits can be used as a rapid and precise controller of variable outputs with minimal circuit configuration.\nDOI:10.1093/nar/gkac206. IF.(y). Citation .

    "text": "Methanotrophs with soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) show high potential for various ecological and biotechnological applications. Here, we developed a high throughput method to identify sMMO-producing microbes by integrating droplet microfluidics and a genetic circuit-based biosensor system. sMMO-producers and sensor cells were encapsulated in monodispersed droplets with benzene as the substrate and incubated for 5 h. The sensor cells were analyzed as the reporter for phenol-sensitive transcription activation of fluorescence. Various combinations of methanotrophs and biosensor cells were investigated to optimize the performance of our droplet-integrated transcriptional factor biosensor system. As a result, the conditions to ensure sMMO activity to convert the starting material, benzene, into phenol, were determined. The biosensor signals were sensitive and quantitative under optimal conditions, showing that phenol is metabolically stable within both cell species and accumulates in picoliter-sized droplets, and the biosensor cells are healthy enough to respond quantitatively to the phenol produced. These results show that our system would be useful for rapid evaluation of phenotypes of methanotrophs showing sMMO activity, while minimizing the necessity of time-consuming cultivation and enzyme preparation, which are required for conventional analysis of sMMO activity.\nDOI:10.1093/nar/gkac206.

Here, we developed a hydrogel-based microfluidic platform for colorimetric profiling of miRNAs, without the use of complex external equipment for fluidics and imaging. For sensitive and reliable measurement without the risk of sequence bias, we employed a gold deposition-based signal amplification scheme and dark-field imaging, and seamlessly integrated a previously developed miRNA assay scheme into this platform. The assay demonstrated a limit of detection of 260 fM, along with multiplexing of small panels of miRNAs in healthy and cancer samples.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Bioconversion of C1 chemicals such as methane and methanol into higher carbon-chain chemicals has been widely studied. Methanol oxidation catalyzed by methanol dehydrogenase (Mdh) is one of the key steps in methanol utilization in bacterial methylotrophy. In bacteria, few NAD+-dependent Mdhs have been reported that convert methanol to formaldehyde. In this study, an uncharacterized Mdh gene from Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus (Lxmdh) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The maximum alcohol oxidation activity of the recombinant enzyme was observed at pH 9.5 and 55°C in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. To improve oxidation activity, rational approach-based, site-directed mutagenesis of 16 residues in the putative active site and NAD+-binding region was performed. The mutations S101V, T141S, and A164F improved the enzyme’s specific activity toward methanol compared to that of the wild-type enzyme. These mutants show a slightly higher turnover rate than that of wild-type, although their K M values were increased compared to that of wild-type. Consequently, according the kinetic results, S101, T141, and A164 positions may related to the catalytic activity in the active site for methanol dehydrogenation. It should be further studied other mutant variants with high activity for methanol. In conclusion, we characterized a new Lxmdh and its variants that may be potentially useful for the development of synthetic methylotrophy in the future.\nDOI:10.1093/nar/gkac206. IF.(y). Citation .

Here, we show that these unique characteristics of σ54-dependent TFs can be used to control the host cell state to be more appropriate for high-throughput screening. The acclimation of cell state was achieved by using guanosine (penta)tetraphosphate ((p)ppGpp)-related genes (relA, spoT) and nutrient conditions, to link the σ54 TF-based reporter expression with the target enzyme activity. By controlling stringent programmed responses and optimizing assay conditions, catalytically improved tyrosine phenol lyase (TPL) enzymes were successfully obtained using a σ54-dependent DmpR as the TF component, demonstrating the practical feasibility of this biosensor.

Despite their importance, well-characterized 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) bioparts are limited. Thus, transcript 3′-ends require further investigation to understand the underlying regulatory role and applications of the 3′-UTR. Here, we revisited the use of Term-Seq in the Escherichia coli strain K-12 MG1655 to enhance our understanding of 3′-UTR regulatory functions and to provide a diverse collection of tunable 3′-UTR bioparts with a wide termination strength range. Comprehensive analysis of 1,629 transcript 3′-end positions revealed multiple 3′-termini classes generated through transcription termination and RNA processing. The examination of individual Rho-independent terminators revealed a reduction in downstream gene expression over a wide range, which led to the design of novel synthetic metabolic valves that control metabolic fluxes in branched pathways. These synthetic metabolic valves determine the optimal balance of heterologous pathways for maximum target biochemical productivity. The regulatory strategy using 3′-UTR bioparts is advantageous over promoter- or 5′-UTR-based transcriptional control as it modulates gene expression at transcription levels without trans-acting element requirements (e.g. transcription factors). Our results provide a foundational platform for 3′-UTR engineering in synthetic biology applications.\nDOI:10.1093/nar/gkac206. IF19.160(2021y). Citation . ISSN no.0305-1048.\nOriginal article"

Despite extensive studies on C1 gas assimilation pathways, their key enzymes have yet to be subjected to high-throughput evolution studies on account of the lack of an efficient analytical tool for C1 metabolites. To address this challenging issue, we attempted to establish a fine-tuned single-cell–level biosensor system constituting a combination of transcription factors (TFs) and several C1-converting enzymes that convert target compounds to the ligand of a TF. This enzymatic conversion broadens the detection range of ligands by the genetic biosensor systems. In this study, we presented new genetic enzyme screening systems (GESSs) to detect formate, formaldehyde, and methanol from specific enzyme activities and pathways, named FA-GESS, Frm-GESS, and MeOH-GESS, respectively. All the biosensors displayed linear responses to their respective C1 molecules, namely, formate (1.0–250 mM), formaldehyde (1.0–50 μM), and methanol (5–400 mM), and they did so with high specificity. Consequently, the helper enzymes, including formaldehyde dehydrogenase and methanol dehydrogenase, were successfully combined to constitute new versatile combinations of the C1-biosensors.\nDOI:10.3390/nar/gkac206.

Unrecycled PET waste causes serious environmental problems. To increase the PET recycling rate, the upcycling of PET into products that are higher value than PET is desired. In this study, the feasibility of biological valorization of PET for its upcycling was experimentally evaluated. Among the two monomers obtained from the chemical hydrolysis of PET, TPA was biologically converted to five different aromatics and aromatic-derived compounds by using whole-cell catalysts comprising Escherichia coli engineered to express necessary metabolic enzymes for biosynthetic routes for converting TPA. These five higher-value products from TPA, gallic acid, pyrogallol, catechol, muconic acid, and vanillic acid were synthesized via protocatechuic acid as the key intermediate at relatively high molar conversion yields, 32.7–92.5%. The other monomer from PET, EG, was fermented to glycolic acid, a cosmetic ingredient.

Herein, a phenol-detecting Tx (DmpR) was employed as a critical tool for enzyme engineering, specifically for the rapid analysis of numerous mutants with multiple mutations at the active site of tryptophan-indole lyase (TIL, EC 4.1.99.1). Cellular fluorescence was monitored cell-by-cell using flow cytometry to detect the creation of phenolic compounds by a new tyrosine-phenol-lyase (TPL, EC 4.1.99.2). In the TIL scaffold, target amino acids near the indole ring (Asp137, Phe304, Val394, Ile396 and His463) were mutated randomly to construct a large diversity of specificity variations. Collection of candidate positives by cell sorting using flow cytometry and subsequent shuffling of beneficial mutations identified a critical hit with four mutations (D137P, F304D, V394L, and I396R) in the TIL sequence. The variant displayed one-thirteenth the level of TPL activity, compared with native TPLs, and completely lost the original TIL activity. The findings demonstrate that hypersensitive, Tx-based biosensors could be useful critically to generate new activity from a related template, which would alleviate the current burden to high-throughput screening.\nDOI:10.1038/nar/gkac206.

    "text": "Metabolons in nature have evolved to facilitate more efficient catalysis of multistep reactions through the co-localization of functionally related enzymes to cellular organelles or membrane structures. To mimic the natural metabolon architecture, we present a novel artificial metabolon that was created by targeting multi-enzyme cascade reactions onto inclusion body (IB) in Escherichia coli. The utility of this system was examined by co-localizing four heterologous enzymes of the 1-butanol pathway onto an IB that was formed in E. coli through overexpression of the cellulose binding domain (CBD) of Cellulomonas fimi exoglucanase. To target the 1-butanol pathway enzymes to the CBD IB, we utilized a peptide-peptide interaction between leucine zipper (LZ) peptides. We genetically fused the LZ peptide to the N-termini of four heterologous genes involved in the synthetic 1-butanol pathway, whereas an antiparallel LZ peptide was fused to the CBD gene. The in vivo activity of the CBD IB-based metabolon was examined through the determination of 1-butanol synthesis using E. coli transformed with two plasmids containing the LZ-fused CBD and LZ-fused 1-butanol pathway genes, respectively. In vivo synthesis of 1-butanol using the engineered E. coli yielded 1.98g/L of 1-butanol from glucose, representing a 1.5-fold increase over that obtained from E. coli expressing the LZ-fused 1-butanol pathway genes alone. In an attempt to examine the in vitro 1-butanol productivity, we reconstituted CBD IB-based metabolon using CBD IB and individual enzymes of 1-butanol pathway. The 1-butanol productivity of in vitro reconstituted CBD IB-based metabolon using acetoacetyl-CoA as the starting material was 2.29mg/L/h, 7.9-fold higher than that obtained from metabolon-free enzymes of 1-butanol pathway. Therefore, this novel CBD-based artificial metabolon may prove useful in metabolic engineering both in vivo and in vitro for the efficient production of desired products.\nDOI:10.1016/nar/gkac206.

The crystal structures of the TodS Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) 1 sensor domain (residues 43–164) and its complex with toluene (agonist) or 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (antagonist) show a typical β2α3β3 PAS fold structure (residues 45–149), forming a hydrophobic ligand-binding site. A signal transfer region (residues 150–163) located immediately after the canonical PAS fold may be intrinsically flexible and disordered in both apo-PAS1 and antagonist-bound forms and dramatically adapt an α-helix upon toluene binding. This structural change in the signal transfer region is proposed to result in signal transmission to activate the TodS/TodT two-component signal transduction system.

In contrast to recent studies on direct miRNA measurements from cell lysate, our hydrogel-based system provides high-confidence quantification with robust performance. The lysis buffer for the assay was optimized to maximize reaction and labeling efficiency, and this assay has a low limit of detection (&lt;1000 cells) without target amplification.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The development of synthetic biological devices has increased rapidly in recent years and the practical benefits of such biological devices are becoming increasingly clear. Here, we further improved the design of a previously reported high-throughput genetic enzyme screening system by investigating device-compatible biological components and phenol-mediated cell-cell communication, both of which increased the efficiency and practicality of the screening device without requiring the use of flow cytometry analysis. A sensor cell was designed to detect novel microbes with target enzyme activities on solid media by forming clear, circular colonies with fluorescence around the unknown microbes producing target enzymes. This mechanism of detection was enabled by the combination of pre-effector phenolic substrate treatment in the presence of target enzyme-producing microbes and control of the growth and fluorescence of remote sensor cells via phenol-mediated cell-cell communication. The sensor cells were applied to screen soil bacteria with phosphatase activity using phenyl phosphate as phenolic substrates. The sensor cells facilitated successful visualization of phosphatase activity in unknown microbes, which were identified by 16S rRNA analysis. Enzyme activity assays confirmed that the proposed screening technique was able to find 23 positive clones out of 33 selected colonies. Since many natural enzymatic reactions produce phenolic compounds from phenol-derived substrates, we anticipate that the proposed technique may have broad applications in the assessment and screening of novel microbes with target enzymes of interest. This method also can provide insights into the identification of novel enzymes for which screening assays are not yet available.\nDOI:10.1021/nar/gkac206. IF.(y). Citation .

    "section": "",
    "text": "Methods for simple and efficient regulation of metabolic pathway genes are essential for maximizing product titers and conversion yields, and for minimizing the metabolic burden caused by heterologous expression of multiple genes often in the operon context. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) interference (CRISPRi) is emerging as a promising tool for transcriptional modulation. In this study, we developed a regulatable CRISPRi system for fine-tuning biosynthetic pathways and thus directing carbon flux toward target product synthesis. By exploiting engineered Escherichia coli harboring a biosynthetic mevalonate (MVA) pathway and plant-derived terpenoid synthases, the CRISPRi system successfully modulated the expression of all the MVA pathway genes in the context of operon and blocked the transcription of the acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the MVA pathway. This CRISPRi-guided balancing of expression of MVA pathway genes led to enhanced production of (-)-α-bisabolol (C15) and lycopene (C40) and alleviation of cell growth inhibition that may be caused by expression of multiple enzymes or production of toxic intermediate metabolites in the MVA pathway. Coupling CRISPRi to cell growth by regulating an endogenous essential gene (ispA) increased isoprene (C5) production. The regulatable CRISPRi system proved to be a robust platform for systematic modulation of biosynthetic and endogenous gene expression, and can be used to tune biosynthetic metabolic pathways. Its application can enable the development of microbial ‘smart cell’ factories that can produce other industrially valuable products in the future.\nDOI:10.1016/nar/gkac206. IF.(y). Citation .

    "text": "Metagenomes constitute a major source for the identification of novel enzymes for industrial applications. However, current functional screening methods are hindered by the limited transcription efficiency of foreign metagenomic genes. To overcome this constraint, we introduced the 'Enforced Transcription' technique, which involves the random insertion of the bi-directional T7 promoter into a metagenomic fosmid library. Then the effect of enforced transcription was quantitatively assessed by screening for metagenomic lipolytic genes encoding enzymes whose catalytic activity forms halos on tributyrin agar plates. The metagenomic library containing the enforced transcription system yielded a significantly increased number of screening hits with lipolytic activity compared to the library without random T7 promoter insertions. Additional sequence analysis revealed that the hits from the enforced transcription library had greater genetic diversity than those from the original metagenome library. Enhancing heterologous expression using the T7 promoter should enable the identification of greater numbers of diverse novel biocatalysts from the metagenome than possible using conventional metagenome screening approaches.\nDOI:10.1016/nar/gkac206.

    "text": "The recent development of a high-throughput single-cell assay technique enables the screening of novel enzymes based on functional activities from a large-scale metagenomic library(1). We previously proposed a genetic enzyme screening system (GESS) that uses dimethylphenol regulator activated by phenol or p-nitrophenol. Since a vast amount of natural enzymatic reactions produce these phenolic compounds from phenol deriving substrates, this single genetic screening system can be theoretically applied to screen over 200 different enzymes in the BRENDA database. Despite the general applicability of GESS, applying the screening process requires a specific procedure to reach the maximum flow cytometry signals. Here, we detail the developed screening process, which includes metagenome preprocessing with GESS and the operation of a flow cytometry sorter. Three different phenolic substrates (p-nitrophenyl acetate, p-nitrophenyl-β-D-cellobioside, and phenyl phosphate) with GESS were used to screen and to identify three different enzymes (lipase, cellulase, and alkaline phosphatase), respectively. The selected metagenomic enzyme activities were confirmed only with the flow cytometry but DNA sequencing and diverse in vitro analysis can be used for further gene identification.\nDOI:10.3791/nar/gkac206.

In this study, we found that a CBD fusion enhanced and improved soluble β-glucuronidase (GusA) enzyme properties through the formation of an artificially oligomeric state. First, a soluble CBD fused to the C-terminus of GusA (GusA-CBD) was obtained and characterized. Interestingly, the soluble GusA-CBD showed maximum activity at higher temperatures (65°C) and more acidic pH values (pH 6.0) than free GusA did (60°C and pH 7.5). Moreover, the GusA-CBD enzyme showed higher thermal and pH stabilities than the free GusA enzyme did. Additionally, GusA-CBD showed higher enzymatic activity in the presence of methanol than free GusA did. Evaluation of the protease accessibility of both enzymes revealed that GusA-CBD retained 100% of its activity after 1 h incubation in 0.5 mg/ml protease K, while free GusA completely lost its activity. Simple fusion of CBD as a single domain may be useful for tunable enzyme states to improve enzyme stability in industrial applications.\nDOI:10.1371/nar/gkac206. IF.(y). Citation .

Type II CRISPR-Cas endonuclease Cas9 is the most widely used protein for gene regulation with CRISPRi. Here, we present type V-A CRISPR-Cas endonuclease Cpf1-based CRISPRi. We constructed an l-rhamnose-inducible CRISPRi system with DNase-deactivated Cpf1 from Eubacterium eligens (EedCpf1) and compared its performance with catalytically deactivated Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes (SpdCas9). In contrast to SpdCas9, EedCpf1 showed stronger gene repression when it was targeted to the template strand than when it was targeted to the nontemplate strand of the 5’ untranslated region or coding DNA sequences. EedCpf1 exhibited no strand bias when targeted to the promoter, and preferentially used the 5’-TTTV-3’ (V = A, G, or C) protospacer adjacent motif. Multiplex repression of the EedCpf1-based CRISPRi system was demonstrated using episomal and chromosomal gene targets.

    "text": "Most inducible expression systems suffer from growth defects, leaky basal induction, and inhomogeneous expression levels within a host cell population. These difficulties are most prominent with the overproduction of membrane proteins that are toxic to host cells. Here, we developed an Escherichia coli inducible expression system for membrane protein production based on titrated expression of a mutant lac repressor (mLacI). Performance of the mLacI inducible system was evaluated in conjunction with commonly used lac operator-based expression vectors using a T7 or tac promoter. Remarkably, expression of a target gene can be titrated by the dose-dependent addition of l-rhamnose, and the expression levels were homogeneous in the cell population. The developed system was successfully applied to overexpress three membrane proteins that were otherwise difficult to produce in E. coli. This gene expression control system can be easily applied to a broad range of existing protein expression systems and should be useful in constructing genetic circuits that require precise output signals.\nDOI:10.1021/nar/gkac206.

    "text": "Successful utilization of cellulose as renewable biomass depends on the development of economically feasible technologies, which can aid in enzymatic hydrolysis. In this study, we developed a whole-cell biosensor for detecting cellulolytic activity that relies on the recognition of cellobiose using the transcriptional factor CelR from Thermobifida fusca and transcriptional activation of its downstream gfp reporter gene. The fluorescence intensity of whole-cell biosensor, which was named as cellobiose-detectible genetic enzyme screening system (CBGESS), was directly proportional to the concentration of cellobiose. The strong fluorescence intensity of CBGESS demonstrated the ability to detect cellulolytic activity with two cellulosic substrates, carboxymethyl cellulose and p-nitrophenyl β-D-cellobioside in cellulase-expressing Escherichia coli. In addition, CBGESS easily sensed crystalline cellulolytic activity when commercial Celluclast 1.5L was dropped on an Avicel plate. Therefore, CBGESS is a powerful tool for detecting cellulolytic activity with high sensitivity in the presence of soluble or insoluble cellulosic substrates. CBGESS may be further applied to excavate novel cellulases or microbes from both genetic libraries and various environments.\nDOI:10.1016/nar/gkac206. IF.(y). Citation .

Over the last decade, microorganisms have emerged as a promising alternative host for efficient and sustainable bioisoprene production. Isoprene synthase (IspS) has received much attention for the conversion of isoprene from dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). Herein, we isolated a highly expressible novel IspS gene from Metrosideros polymorpha (MpIspS), which was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, using a plant cDNA library and characterized its molecular and biochemical properties.\nDOI:10.1186/nar/gkac206.

    "text": "Biocatalytic cyclization is highly desirable for efficient synthesis of biologically derived chemical substances, such as the commodity chemicals ε-caprolactam and δ-valerolactam. To identify biocatalysts in lactam biosynthesis, we develop a caprolactam-detecting genetic enzyme screening system (CL-GESS). The Alcaligenes faecalis regulatory protein NitR is adopted for the highly specific detection of lactam compounds against lactam biosynthetic intermediates. We further systematically optimize the genetic components of the CL-GESS to enhance sensitivity, achieving 10-fold improvement. Using this highly sensitive GESS, we screen marine metagenomes and find an enzyme that cyclizes ω-amino fatty acids to lactam. Moreover, we determine the X-ray crystal structure and catalytic residues based on mutational analysis of the cyclase. The cyclase is also used as a helper enzyme to sense intracellular ω-amino fatty acids. We expect this simple and accurate biosensor to have wide-ranging applications in rapid screening of new lactam-synthesizing enzymes and metabolic engineering for lactam bio-production.\nDOI:10.1038/nar/gkac206.

Protein was the main organic material (67.7% of volatile solids in the sludge). The bacteriophage T4 lysozyme (T4L) was tested for hydrolysis and biochemical methane potential. Variations in the volatile suspended solid (VSS) concentration and biogas production were monitored. The VSS reduction efficiencies by hydrolysis using T4L for 72 h increased and ranged from 17.8% to 26.4%. Biogas production using T4L treated sludges increased and biogas production was increased by as much as 82.4%. Biogas production rate also increased, and the average reaction rate coefficient of first-order kinetics was 0.56 ± 0.02/d, which was up to 47.5% higher compared to the untreated samples at the maximum.

Four genomic mutations were found in the evolved strain through whole-genome sequencing, and two major mutations (in cspC and patZ) mainly contributed to efficient utilization of acetate and tolerance to acetate. Transcriptomic reprogramming was examined by analyzing the genome-wide transcriptome with different carbon sources. The evolved strain showed high levels of intracellular ATP by upregulation of genes involved in NADH and ATP biosynthesis, which facilitated the production of enhanced green fluorescent protein, mevalonate, and n-butanol using acetate alone.

Recently, lysozyme has gained attention for use in accelerating the degradation of secondary sludge, which mainly consists of bacteria.

We first cloned bacteriophage T4 lysozyme (T4L) into a plasmid under control of the araBAD promoter. The plasmid was expressed in Escherichia coli with no toxic effects on growth. Next, we observed that increased soluble T4L expression decreased the fluorescence produced by the genetic enzyme screening system. To investigate T4L evolution based on this finding, we generated a T4L random mutation library, which was screened using the genetic enzyme screening system. Finally, we identified two T4L variants showing 1.4-fold enhanced lytic activity compared to native T4L. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the use of a genetically encoded biosensor to investigate bacteriophage T4L evolution.

However, the limited number of transcription factors and their broad substrate specificity result in ambiguity in small molecule identification. This study presents a new small molecule fingerprinting technique using evolutionary biosensor arrays with a machine learning technique that can capture highly specific substrate signals. Employing multiple mutant transcription factors derived from a single transcription factor has effectively circumvented the limited availability of transcription factors induced by a small molecule of our interest. This method achieved up to 95.3% true positive rate for identifying small molecules, and the high-resolution protein engineering technique improved the limit of detection 75-fold. The signal trade-offs with background noises caused by the complex cellular biochemistry of mutant transcription factors enable the biosensor arrays to be more informative in terms of statistical variance. The machine learning technology, coupled with the single transcription factor-driven evolutionary biosensor array, will open new avenues for molecular fingerprinting technologies.\nDOI:10.1093/nar/gkac206.

Even though it was discovered more than two decades ago and has been widely used for aromatic hydrocarbon sensing, the activation mechanism of DmpR has remained elusive. Here, we show that phenol-bound DmpR forms a tetramer composed of two head-to-head dimers in a head-to-tail arrangement. The DmpR-phenol complex exhibits altered conformations within the C-termini of the sensory domains and shows an asymmetric orientation and angle in its coiled-coil linkers. The structural changes within the phenol binding sites and the downstream ATPase domains suggest that the effector binding signal is propagated through the coiled-coil helixes. The tetrameric DmpR-phenol complex interacts with the σ54 subunit of RNA polymerase in presence of an ATP analogue, indicating that DmpR-like bEBPs tetramers utilize a mechanistic mode distinct from that of hexameric AAA+ ATPases to activate σ54-dependent transcription.\nDOI:10.1093/nar/gkac206.

In this study, we applied a transcriptional factor-based biosensor for the direct evolution of Mdh from Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus (Lxmdh), which has a relatively high turnover rate and low KM value compared to other wild-type NAD-dependent Mdhs. A random mutant library of Lxmdh was constructed in Escherichia coli and was screened using formaldehyde-detectable biosensors by incubation with low methanol concentrations. Positive clones showing higher fluorescence were selected by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) system, and their catalytic activities toward methanol were evaluated. The successfully isolated mutants E396V, K318N, and K46E showed high activity, particularly at very low methanol concentrations. In kinetic analysis, mutant E396V, K318N, and K46E had superior methanol conversion efficiency, with 79-, 23-, and 3-fold improvements compared to the wild-type, respectively.

We determine the FmDTA structure at a 2.2 Å resolution and propose a DTA catalytic mechanism with a kernel of the Lys49 inner proton sink and metal ion in the aldol reaction cycle. The enzyme is rationally engineered to have high Cβ-stereoselectivity based on spatial constraint at the anti-specific aldehyde position in the mechanism, and the rational strategy is further applied to other DTAs for syn-production. The final FmDTAG179A/S312A variant exhibits a near-perfect 99.5% de value for d-threonine and maintains the de value above 93% even under kinetically unfavorable conditions.

Here, we engineer B. thetaiotaomicron for heterologous production of non-native butyrate as a proof-of-concept biochemical at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Since B. thetaiotaomicron is not a natural producer of butyrate, we heterologously expressed a butyrate biosynthetic pathway in the strain, which led to the production of butyrate at the final concentration of 12 mg/L in a rich medium. Further optimization of butyrate production was achieved by a round of metabolic engineering guided by an expanded genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of B. thetaiotaomicron. The in silico knock-out simulation of the expanded model showed that pta and ldhD were the potent knock-out targets to enhance butyrate production. The maximum titer and specific productivity of butyrate in the pta-ldhD double knockout mutant increased by nearly 3.4 and 4.8 folds, respectively.

Here, we revisited the use of Term-Seq in the Escherichia coli strain K-12 MG1655 to enhance our understanding of 3′-UTR regulatory functions and to provide a diverse collection of tunable 3′-UTR bioparts with a wide termination strength range. Comprehensive analysis of 1,629 transcript 3′-end positions revealed multiple 3′-termini classes generated through transcription termination and RNA processing. The examination of individual Rho-independent terminators revealed a reduction in downstream gene expression over a wide range, which led to the design of novel synthetic metabolic valves that control metabolic fluxes in branched pathways. These synthetic metabolic valves determine the optimal balance of heterologous pathways for maximum target biochemical productivity. The regulatory strategy using 3′-UTR bioparts is advantageous over promoter- or 5′-UTR-based transcriptional control as it modulates gene expression at transcription levels without trans-acting element requirements (e.g. transcription factors).

Its beneficial effects were confirmed by higher conversions and recurrent applications of the mutant enzyme, compared to the wild-type. This study showed that rapid directed evolution with biosensors coupled to designed substrates is useful to develop biocatalytic processes.\n70, 1203-1211. DOI:10.1021/acs.jafc.1c05834.
