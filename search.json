    "section": "",
    "text": "This study presents a novel DNA part characterization technique that increases throughput by combinatorial DNA part assembly, solid plate-based quantitative fluorescence assay for phenotyping, and barcode tagging-based long-read sequencing for genotyping. We confirmed that the fluorescence intensities of colonies on plates were comparable to fluorescence at the single-cell level from a high-end, flow-cytometry device and developed a high-throughput image analysis pipeline. The barcode tagging-based long-read sequencing technique enabled rapid identification of all DNA parts and their combinations with a single sequencing experiment. Using our techniques, forty-four DNA parts (21 promoters and 23 RBSs) were successfully characterized in 72 h without any automated equipment. We anticipate that this high-throughput and easy-to-use part characterization technique will contribute to increasing part diversity and be useful for building genetic circuits and metabolic pathways in synthetic biology.\n32(8), 1026-1033.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ceramides are a major lipid class known to play an essential role in maintaining skin function. Thus, efforts have been made to produce ceramides and ceramide precursors in large quantities for industrial applications. The yeast Wickerhamomyces ciferrii, a natural producer of the ceramide precursor tetraacetyl phytosphingosine (TAPS), has been isolated and engineered through various mutagenesis approaches aiming to enhance TAPS production. Herein, a high-throughput screening platform for isolating W. ciferrii mutants with improved TAPS production is described. A fluorescence-mediated reporter system that allows initial quantification of TAPS content in yeast cells based on BODIPY staining was developed. The optimal concentration of BODIPY for monitoring intracellular TAPS levels in W. ciferrii was 400 µg/L, as shown by a linear correlation between the actual TAPS levels and mean fluorescence intensities. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting was used for isolating high TAPS-producing strains from an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant library. After several rounds of sorting, mutants exhibiting a high-TAPS phenotype were isolated, and the M40 strain with the highest TAPS titer was chosen for large-scale cultivation. The influence of different carbon sources for optimizing TAPS production was also evaluated using the M40 strain. A maximum production yield of 5.114 g/L of ceramide precursors, including TAPS and triacetyl phytosphingosine, was achieved with the supplementation of molasses. This novel platform enables rapid screening of high TAPS-producing strains using the common dye BODIPY and can be easily extended for the development of mutants with high productivity of ceramide precursors in yeast and other microorganisms.\nKorean Journal of Chemical Engineering. 39, 4, 1004–1010.

    "text": "Methanotrophs are promising and sustainable cell factory platforms owing to their ability to convert the most potent greenhouse gas, methane to valuable bioproducts. Genetic engineering toolkits for methanotrophs are extremely limited. Here, we present a phenol-inducible promoter for the high-level expression of exogenous genes in methanotrophs. The phenol-inducible gene expression system showed high dose-dependency and homogeneity in methanotrophs. Using the phenol-inducible CRISPR-base editor (BE), we developed a highly efficient methanotroph genome editing system. The CRISPR-BE system efficiently introduced an early stop codon into the target gene, enabling one-step markerless genome editing in Methylococcus capsulatus Bath. We adopted this simple and efficient genome editing tool to produce mevalonate in the engineered M. capsulatus Bath. The native phosphoketolase pathway was reinforced in M. capsulatus Bath to increase the carbon flux via acetyl-CoA towards mevalonate. This engineered M. capsulatus Bath produced the maximum concentration of 2,090 mg/L mevalonate from methane, which is the highest amount of synthetic biochemicals produced from methane in methanotrophs. Here we present not only an efficient addition to the genetic engineering toolkit for methanotrophs but also a useful platform for the development of a methanotroph cell factory.\nIF16.744(2021y). eISSN no. 1873-3212.

    "section": "",
    "text": "As the design of genetic circuitry for synthetic biology becomes more sophisticated, diverse regulatory bioparts are required. Despite their importance, well-characterized 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) bioparts are limited. Thus, transcript 3′-ends require further investigation to understand the underlying regulatory role and applications of the 3′-UTR. Here, we revisited the use of Term-Seq in the Escherichia coli strain K-12 MG1655 to enhance our understanding of 3′-UTR regulatory functions and to provide a diverse collection of tunable 3′-UTR bioparts with a wide termination strength range. Comprehensive analysis of 1,629 transcript 3′-end positions revealed multiple 3′-termini classes generated through transcription termination and RNA processing. The examination of individual Rho-independent terminators revealed a reduction in downstream gene expression over a wide range, which led to the design of novel synthetic metabolic valves that control metabolic fluxes in branched pathways. These synthetic metabolic valves determine the optimal balance of heterologous pathways for maximum target biochemical productivity. The regulatory strategy using 3′-UTR bioparts is advantageous over promoter- or 5′-UTR-based transcriptional control as it modulates gene expression at transcription levels without trans-acting element requirements (e.g. transcription factors). Our results provide a foundational platform for 3′-UTR engineering in synthetic biology applications.\nDOI:10.1093/nar/gkac206. IF19.160(2021y). Citation . ISSN no.0305-1048.\nOriginal article"

    "text": "Genetic circuits have been developed for quantitative measurement of enzyme activity, metabolic engineering of strain development, and dynamic regulation of microbial cells. A genetic circuit consists of several bio-elements, including enzymes and regulatory cassettes, that can generate the desired output signal, which is then used as a precise criterion for enzyme screening and engineering. Antagonists and inhibitors are small molecules with inhibitory effects on regulators and enzymes, respectively. In this study, an antagonist and an inhibitor were applied to a genetic circuit for a dynamic detection range. We developed a genetic circuit relying on regulators and enzymes, allowing for straightforward control of its output signal without additional genetic modification. We used para-nitrophenol and alanine as an antagonist of DmpR and inhibitor of tyrosine phenol-lyase, respectively. We show that the antagonist resets the detection range of the genetic circuit similarly to a resistor in an electrical logic circuit. These biological resistors in genetic circuits can be used as a rapid and precise controller of variable outputs with minimal circuit configuration.\n7, 599878. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2020.599878 IF5.246(2020)\nOriginal article"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Antibiotics have been widely used for plasmid-mediated cell engineering. However, continued use of antibiotics increases the metabolic burden, horizontal gene transfer risks, and biomanufacturing costs. There are limited approaches to maintaining multiple plasmids without antibiotics. Herein, we developed an inverter cascade using CRISPRi by building a plasmid containing a single guide RNA (sgRNA) landing pad (pSLiP); this inhibited host cell growth by repressing an essential cellular gene. Anti-sgRNAs on separate plasmids restored cell growth by blocking the expression of growth-inhibitory sgRNAs in pSLiP. We maintained three plasmids in Escherichia coli with a single antibiotic selective marker. To completely avoid antibiotic use and maintain the CRISPRi-based logic inverter cascade, we created a novel D-glutamate auxotrophic E. coli. This enabled the stable maintenance of the plasmid without antibiotics, enhanced the production of the terpenoid, (−)-α-bisabolol, and generation of an antibiotic-resistance gene-free plasmid. CRISPRi is therefore widely applicable in genetic circuits and may allow for antibiotic-free biomanufacturing.\nIF19.160(2021y). ISSN no.0305-1048. SCIE.\nOriginal article"

    "text": "Enantiomerically pure d-amino acids are important intermediates as chiral building blocks for peptidomimetics and semisynthetic antibiotics. Here, a transcriptional factor-based screening strategy was used for the rapid screening of d-stereospecific amino acid amidase via an enzyme-specific amidophenol substrate. We used a d-threonine amidophenyl derivative to produce 2-aminophenol that serves as a putative enzyme indicator in the presence of d-threonine amidases. Comparative analyses of known bacterial species indicated that several Bacillus strains produce amidase and form putative indicators in culture media. The estimated amidase was cloned and subjected to rapid directed evolution through biosensor cells. Consequently, we characterized the F119A mutation that significantly improved the catalytic activity toward d-alanine, d-threonine, and d-glutamate. Its beneficial effects were confirmed by higher conversions and recurrent applications of the mutant enzyme, compared to the wild-type. This study showed that rapid directed evolution with biosensors coupled to designed substrates is useful to develop biocatalytic processes.\n70, 1203-1211. DOI:10.1021/acs.jafc.1c05834.
