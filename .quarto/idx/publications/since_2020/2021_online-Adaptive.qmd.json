However, uniform spheroid culture on these devices is difficult as the liquid around the spheroid is replaced by direct pipetting, which can cause spheroid damage or loss, and well-to-well variation. If spheroids need to be cultured for a long time or analyzed through chemical treatment of immunostaining, it becomes a more considerable problem as the number of pipetting action increases. To address these problems, we have developed a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-based drop array chip (DAC) and a pillar array chip (PAC) that can apply a droplet contact-based spheroid transfer (DCST) technique to multiple reagent change or washing steps of spheroid assays. Unlike previous DCST devices, 3D-printed mold-based DCST devices showed stable spheroid manipulation during repetitive drop contact and facile transfer of spheroid arrays to the next reagent-loaded DAC while minimizing cross-contamination of the reagents. Compared to the conventional manual or machine pipetting method, the DCST method showed lower user-to-user variation and a higher spheroid retention rate in the manipulation of the spheroid array. Live/dead staining, hypoxia staining, and immunofluorescence staining of the spheroid array were performed on a breast cancer cell line, BT-474. Furthermore, four clearing methods were applied to the spheroid array as a proof of concept, and we have identified the applicability of the DCST platform as a pretreatment platform for whole spheroid analysis.\n\nDOI:10.1093/nar/gkac206.
