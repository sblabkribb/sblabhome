We describe a molecular sensing mechanism of TodS that is activated in response to toluene. The crystal structures of the TodS Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) 1 sensor domain (residues 43--164) and its complex with toluene (agonist) or 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (antagonist) show a typical β2α3β3 PAS fold structure (residues 45--149), forming a hydrophobic ligand-binding site. A signal transfer region (residues 150--163) located immediately after the canonical PAS fold may be intrinsically flexible and disordered in both apo-PAS1 and antagonist-bound forms and dramatically adapt an α-helix upon toluene binding. This structural change in the signal transfer region is proposed to result in signal transmission to activate the TodS/TodT two-component signal transduction system. Site-directed mutagenesis and β-galactosidase assays using a *P. putida* reporter strain system verified the essential residues involved in ligand sensing and signal transfer and suggest that the Phe^46^ residue acts as a ligand-specific switch.\n\nDOI:10.1074/nar/gkac206.
