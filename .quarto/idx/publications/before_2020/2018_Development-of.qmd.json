The strong fluorescence intensity of CBGESS demonstrated the ability to detect cellulolytic activity with two cellulosic substrates, carboxymethyl cellulose and *p*-nitrophenyl β-D-cellobioside in cellulase-expressing *Escherichia coli*. In addition, CBGESS easily sensed crystalline cellulolytic activity when commercial Celluclast 1.5L was dropped on an Avicel plate. Therefore, CBGESS is a powerful tool for detecting cellulolytic activity with high sensitivity in the presence of soluble or insoluble cellulosic substrates. CBGESS may be further applied to excavate novel cellulases or microbes from both genetic libraries and various environments.\n\nDOI:10.1016/nar/gkac206. IF.(y). Citation .
