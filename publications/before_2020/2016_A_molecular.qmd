![](images/paste-781A0CE2.png)RNase H is an endonuclease that catalyzes the cleavage of RNA. Because it only acts on RNA in RNA:DNA hybrids, RNase H can be used for targeted degradation of RNA when used in combination with antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ASODNs) designed against a specific sequence of the target RNA. In this study, ASODN and RNase H were co-conjugated on magnetic nanoparticles. The resulting nanoparticles, having integrated functions of probing and processing target RNA, were able to remove target mRNA sequences more effectively than free ASODNs. The paramagnetic property of the nanoparticles also enabled timed engagement and disengagement of the RNA-degrading components in a given system, and these nanoparticles were able to be used for ON/OFF control of gene expression during cell-free protein synthesis reactions.
