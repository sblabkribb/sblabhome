To identify biocatalysts in lactam biosynthesis, we develop a caprolactam-detecting genetic enzyme screening system (CL-GESS). The *Alcaligenes faecalis* regulatory protein NitR is adopted for the highly specific detection of lactam compounds against lactam biosynthetic intermediates. We further systematically optimize the genetic components of the CL-GESS to enhance sensitivity, achieving 10-fold improvement. Using this highly sensitive GESS, we screen marine metagenomes and find an enzyme that cyclizes ω-amino fatty acids to lactam. Moreover, we determine the X-ray crystal structure and catalytic residues based on mutational analysis of the cyclase. The cyclase is also used as a helper enzyme to sense intracellular ω-amino fatty acids. We expect this simple and accurate biosensor to have wide-ranging applications in rapid screening of new lactam-synthesizing enzymes and metabolic engineering for lactam bio-production.
