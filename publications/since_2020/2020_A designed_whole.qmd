Here, we developed a designer probiotic *Escherichia coli* that senses and responds to nitrate, a biomarker of gut inflammation. To this end, we first employed the NarX-NarL two-component regulatory system in *E. coli* to construct a nitrate-responsive genetic circuit. Next, we optimized the nitrate biosensor for the best performance using measures of sensitivity and specificity. We then introduced this genetic circuit into a probiotic *E. coli* Nissle 1917. We demonstrated that the designed biosensor can sense elevated nitrate levels during gut inflammation in mice with native gut microbiota. Moreover, using Boolean AND gate, we generated a genetically encoded biosensor for simultaneous sensing of the [thiosulfate](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/thiosulfate "Learn more about thiosulfate from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and nitrate biomarkers, thus increasing the tool's specificity for diagnosing gut inflammation. The nitrate-responsive genetic circuit will enable new approaches for non-invasive diagnostics of inflammation-associated diseases.
