However, the limited number of transcription factors and their broad [substrate specificity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/substrate-specificity "Learn more about substrate specificity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") result in ambiguity in [small molecule](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/small-molecule "Learn more about small molecule from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") identification. This study presents a new small molecule [fingerprinting technique](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/fingerprinting-technique "Learn more about fingerprinting technique from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") using evolutionary biosensor arrays with a [machine learning technique](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/machine-learning-technique "Learn more about machine learning technique from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") that can capture highly specific substrate signals. Employing multiple mutant transcription factors derived from a single transcription factor has effectively circumvented the limited availability of transcription factors induced by a small molecule of our interest. This method achieved up to 95.3% true positive rate for identifying small molecules, and the high-resolution [protein engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/protein-engineering "Learn more about protein engineering from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") technique improved the limit of detection 75-fold. The signal trade-offs with background noises caused by the complex cellular [biochemistry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/biochemistry "Learn more about biochemistry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of mutant transcription factors enable the biosensor arrays to be more informative in terms of statistical variance. The machine learning technology, coupled with the single transcription factor-driven evolutionary biosensor array, will open new avenues for molecular fingerprinting technologies.
