Antibiotics have been widely used for plasmid-mediated cell engineering. However, continued use of antibiotics increases the metabolic burden, horizontal gene transfer risks, and biomanufacturing costs. There are limited approaches to maintaining multiple plasmids without antibiotics. Herein, we developed an inverter cascade using CRISPRi by building a plasmid containing a single guide RNA (sgRNA) landing pad (pSLiP); this inhibited host cell growth by repressing an essential cellular gene. Anti-sgRNAs on separate plasmids restored cell growth by blocking the expression of growth-inhibitory sgRNAs in pSLiP. We maintained three plasmids in *Escherichia coli* with a single antibiotic selective marker. To completely avoid antibiotic use and maintain the CRISPRi-based logic inverter cascade, we created a novel D-glutamate auxotrophic *E. coli*. This enabled the stable maintenance of the plasmid without antibiotics, enhanced the production of the terpenoid, (−)-α-bisabolol, and generation of an antibiotic-resistance gene-free plasmid. CRISPRi is therefore widely applicable in genetic circuits and may allow for antibiotic-free biomanufacturing.
