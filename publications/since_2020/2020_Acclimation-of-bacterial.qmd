Sigma 54 (σ^54^)-dependent transcription factor (TF) can be a valuable component of these biosensors owing to its intrinsic silent property compared to most of the housekeeping sigma 70 (σ^70^) TFs. Here, we show that these unique characteristics of σ^54^-dependent TFs can be used to control the host cell state to be more appropriate for high-throughput screening. The acclimation of cell state was achieved by using guanosine (penta)tetraphosphate ((p)ppGpp)-related genes (*relA*, *spoT*) and nutrient conditions, to link the σ^54^ TF-based reporter expression with the target enzyme activity. By controlling stringent programmed responses and optimizing assay conditions, catalytically improved tyrosine phenol lyase (TPL) enzymes were successfully obtained using a σ^54^-dependent DmpR as the TF component, demonstrating the practical feasibility of this biosensor. This combinatorial strategy of biosensors using σ factor-dependent TFs will allow for more effective high-throughput enzyme engineering with broad applicability.
