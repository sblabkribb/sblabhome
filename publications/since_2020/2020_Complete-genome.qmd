*Methylomonas koyamae* LM6 is a potential methanotrophic bacterium of interest for methane bioconversion. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of *M. koyamae* LM6, which contains 4,337 predicted open reading frames on one chromosome (4,894,002 bp) and one plasmid (186,658 bp), with genes involved in methane oxidation.
