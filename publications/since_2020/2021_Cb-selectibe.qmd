[d]{.smallcaps}-Threonine aldolase (DTA) is a useful biocatalyst that reversibly converts glycine and aldehyde to β-hydroxy-α-[d]{.smallcaps}-amino acid. However, low activity and poor diastereoselectivity limit its applications. Here we report DTA from *Filomicrobium marinum* (*Fm*DTA) that shows much higher activity and Cβ-stereoselectivity in [d]{.smallcaps}-threonine production compared with those of other known DTAs. We determine the *Fm*DTA structure at a 2.2 Å resolution and propose a DTA catalytic mechanism with a kernel of the Lys49 inner proton sink and metal ion in the aldol reaction cycle. The enzyme is rationally engineered to have high Cβ-stereoselectivity based on spatial constraint at the *anti*-specific aldehyde position in the mechanism, and the rational strategy is further applied to other DTAs for *syn*-production. The final *Fm*DTA^G179A/S312A^ variant exhibits a near-perfect 99.5% de value for [d]{.smallcaps}-threonine and maintains the de value above 93% even under kinetically unfavorable conditions. This study demonstrates how a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism can be used for rational protein engineering.
