(−)-α-Bisabolol is a functional ingredient in various health and cosmetic products and has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and wound healing properties. (−)-α-Bisabolol is chemically synthesized and produced by steam distillation of essential oils extracted from Brazilian Candeia (*Eremanthus erythropappus*). To sustainably produce pure (−)-α-bisabolol, we previously engineered *Escherichia coli* to produce 9.1 g/L (−)-α-bisabolol via heterologous mevalonate pathways and (−)-α-bisabolol synthase (BOS) from German chamomile, *Matricaria recutita* (MrBOS). BOS has only been reported in MrBOS and Brazilian Candeia (EeBOS). The limited availability of BOS has made it difficult to achieve high titer and yield and large-scale (−)-α-bisabolol production. We identified a novel BOS in globe artichoke (CcBOS) and examined its functionality *in vitro* and *in vivo*. CcBOS showed higher catalytic efficiency and (−)-α-bisabolol production rates than those from MrBOS or EeBOS. In fed-batch fermentation, CcBOS generated the highest reported (−)-α-bisabolol titer to date (23.4 g/L). These results may facilitate economically viable industrial (−)-α-bisabolol production.
